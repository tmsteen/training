"""Variable Positional Arguments

This demo program has a function that takes a variable number of
parameters and shows how a collector assembles them all in a tuple.
By tradition, we use *args for positional parameters and **kwargs
for keyword parameters.

But, what if you have a collection (e.g., a list) that you want
to pass to a function that is expecting individual elements.  Use
the * operator to pass the elements of the list instead of the
list itself.
