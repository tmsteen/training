:mod:`lab_requests` -- interacting with REST
=========================================

LAB_REQUESTS Learning Objective: Learn to interact with RESTful APIs using requests library
::

 a. Using requests, HTTP GET the initial page from the url given to you by the instructor.
    http://23.253.100.130

 b. Using the JSON you receive from the server, determine the next url you are to open.
    Use HTTP POST to send the `token` you received from the initial page back to the server
    at the next url to load the second page.

    The returned JSON object will be in the form: {'<some_key>': url, 'token': <your_token>}
    where <some_key> will change for each access and <your_token> will be the same token you
    sent to the server.

    Your post JSON should be only one element: {'token': <your_token> }

 c. Continue the pattern from step b until you get a JSON response that contains the element
    called `answer`.  Print out the final object you recieved from the server.

 Note: the token has a short timeout, so you will have to pull all the steps in a loop,
       otherwise the token will invalidate due to timeout

import requests  # noqa

# Load the first page using an HTTP GET
# Begin loop:
#     parse the JSON object to find the next url
#     load the url using an HTTP POST
#     stop the loop when the JSON object has the key: "answer"
# Print the final JSON response

# Note: if you need to debug your HTTP connection info, call the following
# function before you do any http calls with requests:

resp = requests.get('http://23.253.100.130')
print(resp.json())
while 'answer' not in resp.json().keys():
    for i in resp.json():
        if 'http' in resp.json()[i]: link = resp.json()[i]

    token = resp.json()['token']

    resp = requests.post(link, json={'token': token})
    print(resp.json())
